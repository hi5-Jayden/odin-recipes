    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>cooking spray</li>
      <li>1 (16 ounce) package farfalle (bow tie) pasta</li>
      <li>Â½ cup unsalted butter</li>
      <li>1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, cubed</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons ranch dressing mix</li>
      <li>2 cups milk</li>
      <li>1 (8 ounce) package shredded Monterey Jack cheese</li>
      <li>8 strips cooked bacon, divided</li>
      <li>2 cooked chicken breasts, shredded</li>
      <li>1 cup shredded Cheddar Jack cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>
          Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat a 9x13-inch
          baking dish with cooking spray.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook bow-tie
          pasta at a boil, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the
          bite, about 12 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Meanwhile, melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add cream
          cheese and ranch mix; whisk until smooth. Slowly whisk in milk. Stir
          in Monterey Jack; cook until melted and sauce thickened, 5 to 10
          minutes. Crumble in 6 strips bacon; stir to combine.
        </li>
        <li>Combine pasta and chicken together in a large bowl. Pour in sauce and mix until well combined; transfer to prepared baking dish. Sprinkle on Cheddar Jack; crumble remaining 2 strips bacon on top.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese melted, about 20 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
